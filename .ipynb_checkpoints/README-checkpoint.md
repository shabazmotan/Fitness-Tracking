Summary

We found data pertaining to daily activity and sleep activity for a number of Fitbit users. We organized the data to show the relationshp between total distance and total calories for each active user. We analyzed the quality of sleep for each active user defined by total minutes asleep and total time in bed. Finally, we created a plot of an a random user to see if the total steps has any correlation to overall qualify of sleep. 

Conclusions:
1) There are total of 33 users studied
3) Strong evidence suggest users moving greater distance burned more overall calories
2) We did not find strong relationship between total steps and quality of sleep for all users
