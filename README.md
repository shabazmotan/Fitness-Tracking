# Summary

Organized Fitbit data to show the relationship between total distance and total calories for each active user. Analyzed the quality of sleep for each active user. 

Conclusions:
1) There are total of 33 users studied
2) Strong evidence suggest users moving greater distance burned more overall calories
3) We did not find strong relationship between total steps and quality of sleep for all users
